<h2 id="driverpass-project-summary">DriverPass Project Summary</h2>
<p>The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a client named Liam, the owner of DriverPass. DriverPass aims to provide online and on-the-road training for students preparing for their driving tests at the DMV. The system needed to handle online classes, practice tests, driving lesson scheduling, and data management, while ensuring security and tracking user activities.</p>
<h2 id="project-highlights">Project Highlights</h2>
<p>One aspect I did particularly well was understanding and documenting the client’s requirements clearly and comprehensively. This helped in creating accurate and detailed use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams that addressed all specified needs.</p>
<h2 id="potential-revisions">Potential Revisions</h2>
<p>If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the UML diagrams. I would focus on making them more detailed and precise, ensuring all possible scenarios and exceptions are accounted for. Adding more specific attributes and methods in the class diagrams would also enhance clarity and functionality.</p>
<h2 id="user-needs-and-implementation">User Needs and Implementation</h2>
<p>I interpreted the user’s needs by actively listening to their requirements and concerns during the initial meeting. I translated these needs into system features and functions in my design. Considering the user’s needs is crucial because it ensures the system is user-friendly, functional, and meets the client’s business objectives.</p>
<h2 id="approach-to-software-design">Approach to Software Design</h2>
<p>In designing software, I approach the task by first gathering and understanding all user requirements. I then create detailed diagrams to visualize the system architecture and workflow. In the future, I would continue to use techniques like UML diagrams for system design and employ user feedback sessions to refine the design continuously. This ensures the system remains aligned with user needs and expectations throughout the development process.</p>
